# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently as there are no true releases, if I become aware of a security issue, I will do my best to fix as soon as I can get to my computer. Hopefully that day will never come, but when it does, I will most likely roll back to a previous version before the issue was part of the code, or if that isn't feasible I will remove the problematic function(s) completely until the breach can be fixed completely.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

My email [tpalmerstudios@gmail.com](mailto:tpalmerstudios@gmail.com) is a good place to reach me for actual security concerns. Also you can obviously add an issue here if it is a flaw that can be taken advantage of remotely and has no immediate exploitability. Upon reporting the issue to me I will most likely get back to you and ask for more details within a day, and you can expect a fix (or temporary solution at least) within a day of me getting back to you. If you know the solution feel free to email me the problem and then make a pull request and I can have it reviewed within an hour or two of me viewing it.
