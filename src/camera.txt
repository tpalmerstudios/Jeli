Basically a rewrite of certain aspects of the game engine
1. All objects and NPCs should have a unique ID and an altitude
2. A custom database would be a great way to learn and implement this
3. Given (height, altitude, and distance) of an object I can adapt to what I see
4. The actual algorithm
    view height = objectHeight/Distance
    positioning = altitudeDelta/Distance
        that is camera altitude - objectAltitude
    each object is saved as its own array
5. Composite based on distance
